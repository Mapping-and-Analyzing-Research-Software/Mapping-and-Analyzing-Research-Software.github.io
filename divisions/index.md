# Divisions

There's a lot of work to do. MARS divides up the work by organizing itself into several divisions.

Each division has an area of ownership, a set of primary users/customers (either internal to MARS or external end-users), and a set of typical deliverables for these users/customers. These divisions are:

**Product development divisions**
- [Website (Frontend) -  UX-UI Design](/divisions/web-design/)
- [Website (Frontend) -  Engineering](/divisions/web-engr/)
- [Core (Backend) Engineering - Business logic and API](/divisions/core-engr-biz-logic/)
- [Core (Backend) Engineering - Data persistence](/divisions/core-engr-data/)
- [Core (Backend) Engineering - Notification](/divisions/core-engr-notification/)
- [Core (Backend) Engineering - Administration](/divisions/core-engr-admin/)
- [Joint Web+Core - Authentication, Authorization, and Security](/divisions/joint-engr-security/)
- [Joint Web+Core - Infrastructure, CI/CD, and Quality Assurance](/divisions/joint-engr-dev-ops/)

**Business divisions**
- [Evangelism, Public relations, Integration, and Community (EPIC)](/divisions/epic/)
- [Budget and Legal](/divisions/budget-and-legal/)
- [Stewardship and People](/divisions/stewardship/) (our governing board)

Each division is described in more detail in the links above. The job responsibilities for [division leads are here](/divisions/lead.md).

There are some [procedures](./procedures.md) for all divisions (such as the appointment of division leads) which are common across MARS.
