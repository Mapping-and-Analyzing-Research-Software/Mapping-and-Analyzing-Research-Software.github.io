# Core (Backend) Engineering - Business logic and API
This division is the primary "backend" division. It owns all the API endpoint code of MARS, which is used by the website and code-writing end users. In writing these API endpoints, this division also writes all the corresponding logic/brains of MARS. Final decisions about the API code and related business logic (except for select security areas) lie with this division.

## Typical users/customers of the division:
The Website (Frontend) - Engineering division, End users of the API, feature stewards.
