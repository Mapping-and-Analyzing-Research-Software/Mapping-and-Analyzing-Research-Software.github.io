# Welcome to MARS!

MARS (*Mapping & Analyzing Research Software*) is a discovery platform, archive service, and analysis toolkit for data about research software (and related researchers/people + research papers).

MARS is primarily for {academics, industry watchers, governments} doing empirical analysis on research software in a variety of sectors and {software foundations, universities, private companies} looking to determine and benchmark analytics/key performance indicators (KPIs) about their own organization's research software against peers.

Unlike going to multiple different websites to track down data or writing complex code to identify and measure KPIs from scratch, users can do this discovery, data archiving + retrieval, and analysis through the MARS website's intuitive interface -- without having to write code. Users with coding ability can also directly connect to our well-documented APIs to power their own systems.

Most of the code for the MARS project itself is open source. The MARS organization is in the process of becoming a 501(c)3 US-based non-profit, with board members nominated + elected though a democratic process by its core contributors / maintainers -- or as we like to call ourselves, **Martians**.

# Contributing

There's a lot of work to do. MARS divides up the work by organizing itself into several divisions.

Each division has an area of ownership, a set of primary users/customers (either internal to MARS or external end-users), and a set of typical deliverables for these users/customers. These divisions are:

**Product development divisions**
- [Website (Frontend) -  UX-UI Design](/divisions/web-design/)
- [Website (Frontend) -  Engineering](/divisions/web-engr/)
- [Core (Backend) Engineering - Business logic and API](/divisions/core-engr-biz-logic/)
- [Core (Backend) Engineering - Data persistence](/divisions/core-engr-data/)
- [Core (Backend) Engineering - Notification](/divisions/core-engr-notification/)
- [Core (Backend) Engineering - Administration](/divisions/core-engr-admin/)
- [Joint Web+Core - Authentication, Authorization, and Security](/divisions/joint-engr-security/)
- [Joint Web+Core - Infrastructure, CI/CD, and Quality Assurance](/divisions/joint-engr-dev-ops/)

**Business divisions**
- [Evangelism, Public relations, Integration, and Community (EPIC)](/divisions/epic/)
- [Budget and Legal](/divisions/budget-and-legal/)
- [Stewardship and People](/divisions/stewardship/) (our governing board)

Each division is described in more detail in the links above.

## Adding a Feature

If you want to add a technical feature to MARS, become a *Feature Steward.*

### Description:
A Feature Steward is someone who is the technical champion of a feature, who guides it through creation and coordinates among the multiple divisions. You take ownership of a feature and agree to steward its creation (and long-term maintenance).

### Typical users/customers of the role:
End Users, other Martians, yourself.

### Typical responsibilities: Delight your users/customers. Your most important role is to serve them.
**How this is done is up to you. When a customer makes a feature request known, we suggest that you:**

1. Work with the customer to determine the requirements of the feature/enhancement.
2. Identify each division which will be needed to develop the feature. Create and/or request technical requirement specifications from divisions, as appropriate.
3. Work with each division to implement the feature. If you yourself write code for the feature, it must get approval from someone else in the division which owns the technology before it's merged into production. E.g., the website UI/UX division signs off on your design for a user interface you sketch, the website engineering division signs off on TypeScript code you write, etc.
4. You attend the weekly meetings and work through challenges, organized around two-week sprint cycles.
5. You agree to maintain the feature and, once it's completed, train at least one other Martian on the technical aspects of it to ensure a high bus factor.

### Minimum time commitment:
- Ad hoc meetings with users/customers and other Martians.
- 1 weekly dev meeting on Thursdays at 2pm PT / 5pm ET.
- 1 monthly all-hands meeting the first Thursday of the month at 1pm PT / 4pm ET.

### Minimum deliverable commitment:
- 1 feature delivered per calendar quarter (~6 two-week sprints).

*Note: Failure to meet the minimum time and deliverable commitments will result in dismissal from the role and the feature mothballed.*
