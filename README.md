# Welcome to MARS!

MARS (*Mapping & Analyzing Research Software*) is a discovery platform, archive service, and analysis toolkit for data about research software (and related researchers/people + research papers).

MARS is primarily for {academics, industry watchers, governments} doing empirical analysis on research software in a variety of sectors and {software foundations, universities, private companies} looking to determine and benchmark analytics/key performance indicators (KPIs) about their own organization's research software against peers.

Unlike going to multiple different websites to track down data or writing complex code to identify and measure KPIs from scratch, users can do this discovery, data archiving + retrieval, and analysis through the MARS website's intuitive interface -- without having to write code. Users with coding ability can also directly connect to our well-documented APIs to power their own systems.

Most of the code for the MARS project itself is open source. The MARS organization is in the process of becoming a 501(c)3 US-based non-profit, with board members nominated + elected though a democratic process by its core contributors / maintainers -- or as we like to call ourselves, **Martians**.

# How Martians work

There's a lot of work to do. MARS divides up the work by organizing itself into several divisions.

Each division has an area of ownership, a set of primary users/customers (either internal Martians or external end-users), and a set of typical deliverables for these users/customers. These divisions are:

**Product development divisions**
- [Website (Frontend) -  UX-UI Design](/divisions/web-design/)
- [Website (Frontend) -  Engineering](/divisions/web-engr/)
- [Core (Backend) Engineering - Business logic and API](/divisions/core-engr-biz-logic/)
- [Core (Backend) Engineering - Data persistence](/divisions/core-engr-data/)
- [Core (Backend) Engineering - Notification](/divisions/core-engr-notification/)
- [Core (Backend) Engineering - Administration](/divisions/core-engr-admin/)
- [Joint Web+Core - Authentication, Authorization, and Security](/divisions/joint-engr-security/)
- [Joint Web+Core - Infrastructure, CI/CD, and Quality Assurance](/divisions/joint-engr-dev-ops/)

**Business divisions**
- [Evangelism, Public relations, Integration, and Community (EPIC)](/divisions/epic/)
- [Budget and Legal](/divisions/budget-and-legal/)
- [Stewardship and People](/divisions/stewardship/) (our governing board)

Each division is described in more detail in the links above.
