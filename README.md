# Welcome to MARS!

MARS (*Mapping & Analyzing Research Software*) is a discovery platform, archive service, and analysis toolkit for data about research software (and related researchers/people + research papers).

MARS is primarily for {academics, industry watchers, governments} doing empirical analysis on research software in a variety of sectors and {software foundations, universities, private companies} looking to determine and benchmark analytics/key performance indicators (KPIs) about their own organization's research software against peers.

Unlike going to multiple different websites to track down data or writing complex code to identify and measure KPIs from scratch, users can do this discovery, data archiving + retrieval, and analysis through the MARS website's intuitive interface -- without having to write code. Users with coding ability can also directly connect to our well-documented APIs to power their own systems.

Most of the code for the MARS project itself is open source. The MARS organization is in the process of becoming a 501(c)3 US-based non-profit, with board members nominated + elected though a democratic process by its core contributors / maintainers -- or as we like to call ourselves, **[Martians](https://mapping-and-analyzing-research-software.github.io/team/)**.

# How Martians work

There's a lot of work for [Martians](https://mapping-and-analyzing-research-software.github.io/team/) to do. MARS divides up the work by organizing itself into several divisions.

Each division has an area of ownership, a set of primary users/customers (either internal Martians or external end-users), and a set of typical deliverables for these users/customers. These divisions are:

# Contributing

[Click here](https://mapping-and-analyzing-research-software.github.io/contribute/) To learn more about contributions and adding features.

First things first, however, contact the lead of the Stewardship and People division (see [team](https://mapping-and-analyzing-research-software.github.io/team/)) to schedule meeting and an invitation to orientation (see [calendar](https://mapping-and-analyzing-research-software.github.io#meetings-and-calendar)). Note that contributing to MARS requires an ongoing commitment in both time and code contributions.

# Meetings and Calendar

Thursdays are when MARS meets. Most Thursdays there are two MARS-related meetings:

1. A "buisness" related meeting of some sort (e.g., an all hands, leadership board meeting, newcommer orientation, etc.) This meeting is at 1pm Pacific Time / 4pm Eastern Time.
2. A "development" related meeting (e.g., feature request meeting or division break out meeting). This meeting is at 2pm Pacific Time / 5pm Eastern Time.

Not all Martians have to attend all meetings. Here's the schedule.

## All Hands

* Person who sets the agenda: Lead of the Stewardship & People Division.
* Purpose: Provide MARS-wide announcements to all Martians, discuss MARS-wide issues, conduct votes on stratigic direction/governance. Will also sometimes invite stakeholders/non-Martians to join.
* Who is required to attend: All Martians

## Dev Meeting

* Person who sets the agenda: Lead of the Stewardship & People Division.
* Purpose: Update and coordinate the software development-related work of MARS.
* Who is required to attend: Leadership and Stewardship Lead, all Martians working in a development division.

In weeks 1-4 of the month, the meeting starts off with brief announcements, any dev-wide Q&A, and Issues (e.g., new features or bug fixes) prioritized and assigned to Martians (e.g., assigned to a Feature Steward and/or specific divisions). This should all be accomplished within 15 minutes or less. Martians then break out into groups (sometimes groups of the whole) based on whether it's a feature week or a division week.

MARS works around two week sprints.
The first meeting of the sprint, is a *feature meeting*. A feature meeting is for Martians all working on a new feature (or non-trivial bug fix) to gather together and plan their work for the week.
The second meeting of the sprint, is a *division meeting*. A division meeting is for Martians to gather with their primary division and coordinate the work they're doing with the rest of the division.

The first sprint happens on weeks 1-2 of the month, the second sprint happens on weeks 3-4.

If a month has five Thursdays (which usually occurs once every 2-3 months), we use that extra "fifth" week to pause and do retrospectives and also celibrate what we've accomplished.

## Marketing / Fundraising / Community / EPIC

* Person who sets the agenda: Lead of the EPIC Division.
* Purpose: Coordinate the development and execution of the current EPIC plan.
* Who is required to attend: EPIC division Martians

## Newcomer Orientation

* Person who sets the agenda: Lead of the Stewardship & People Division.
* Purpose: Properly onboard every new Martian **BEFORE** the new Martian starts attending other meetings, contributing to GitHub, etc.
* Who is required to attend: New Martians (and, optionally, their division lead).

## Board Meeting

* Person who sets the agenda: Lead of the Stewardship & People Division.
* Purpose: Work with Martians to design stratigic vision for MARS, develop and approve budget, conduct legal compliance tasks.
* Who is required to attend: Leadership and Stewardship Lead, Budget and Legal Lead.
